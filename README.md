# Display Frame

This repo contains various effects to be displayed on a 32x8 LED matrix. More information within the resp. subdirectory.

## Frame
The (not yet available) 3D printable `matrix_frame.blend` (will be) is the frame for the matrix in case you want to print one for yourself. You'll also need a 335x95x5 mm dark tinted acrylic glass panel as well as a sheet of paper as diffusor at the same size.

## To do and future ideas

* color fade for clock
* centralizing matrix class
