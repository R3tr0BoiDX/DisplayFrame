# Display Frame

This repo contains various effects to be displayed on a 32x8 LED matrix. More information within the resp. subdirectory.

## Frame
`matrix_frame.blend` (will be) is a (not yet available) 3D printable frame for the matrix. You may also want a 335x95x5 mm dark tinted acrylic glass panel as well as a sheet of paper as diffusor of the same size.

## To do and future ideas

* color fade for clock
* centralizing matrix class
* optimize and fix fire
* use fire and random color as clock background
