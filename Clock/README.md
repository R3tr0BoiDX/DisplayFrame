# Clock
Show time and local weather

## Config file
This is needed to get the correct weather. You'll need an OpenWeather account and an API key (FREE!). Create and fill in the `config.json` with your settings. You can use the config.example.json as starting point. See https://openweathermap.org/current for valid config entries. An example for a valid config file could be:
```json
{
  "lat": 51.19,
  "lon": -1.82,
  "units": "metric",
  "lang": "en",
  "appid": "9f5pksway3c7jb7q43n33o75u388i9hk"
}
```
(*Note: API key isn't real. That's a randomly generated example key.*)
